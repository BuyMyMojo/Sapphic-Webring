## How do I join?

Requests are approved on a case-by-case basis. If we know you, or are mutuals, in most cases you will be automatically accepted. You're still free to request, though!

### Instructions:

1. Choose a slug for your website. This will uniquely identify you.
2. Create a pull request on [GitHub](https://github.com/SapphoSys/webring) with the following information:
```json
{
  "name": "your name",
  "slug": "your slug",
  "about": "A short description of you or your website.",
  "url": "https://your.website",
  "rss": "https://your.website/rss", // This step is optional.
  "owner": "your.email@example.com"
}
```
3. Wait for your request to be approved. You will receive a notification on GitHub.
4. Once approved, add the webring to your website by using the following links:
```html
<a href="https://ring.sapphic.moe/your-slug/previous">‚Üê</a>
<a href="https://ring.sapphic.moe">Sapphic Webring</a>

```
5. If your request is not approved within 3 days, please visit our [contact page](https://sapphic.moe/contact).
